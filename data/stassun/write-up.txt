As an independent determination of the basic stellar parameters, we performed an analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the stars together with the {\it Gaia\/} DR3 parallax \citep[with no systematic offset applied; see, e.g.,][]{StassunTorres:2021}, in order to determine an empirical measurement of the stellar radius, following the procedures described in \citet{Stassun:2016,Stassun:2017,Stassun:2018}. We pulled the the $JHK_S$ magnitudes from {\it 2MASS}, the W1--W4 magnitudes from {\it WISE}, the $G_{\rm BP} G_{\rm RP}$ magnitudes from {\it Gaia}, and the $BVgri$ magnitudes from {\it APASS}, and where available the NUV magnitude from {\it GALEX}. Together, the available photometry spans the full stellar SED over at least the wavelength range 0.4--10~$\mu$m and up to 0.2â€”20~$\mu$m (see Figure~\ref{fig:sed}).  

We performed a fit using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models \citep{Husser:2013}, with the main parameters being the effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) and metallicity ([Fe/H]), which we adopted from the spectroscopic values, as well as the extinction $A_V$, which we limited to maximum line-of-sight value from the Galactic dust maps of \citet{Schlegel:1998}. The resulting fits (Figure~\ref{fig:sed}) have a best-fit $A_V = 0.02 \pm 0.02$ and $0.01 \pm 0.01$ for TOI-1199 and TOI-1273, respectively, with a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.2 and 1.4, respectively. Integrating the (unreddened) model SED gives the bolometric flux at Earth, $F_{\rm bol} = 1.0553 \pm 0.0017 \times 10^{-9}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ and $1.097 \pm 0.013 \times 10^{-9}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$, respectively. Taking the $F_{\rm bol}$ together with the {\it Gaia\/} parallax, gives the bolometric luminosity directly, $L_{\rm bol} = 2.0145 \pm 0.0084$~L$_{\rm bol}$ and $1.068 \pm 0.013$~L$_{\rm bol}$, respectively. The stellar radius then follows from the Stefan-Boltzmann relation, giving $R_\star = 1.452 \pm 0.031$~R$_\odot$ and $1.063 \pm 0.020$~R$_\odot$, respectively. In addition, we can estimate the stellar mass from the empirical relations of \citet{Torres:2010}, giving $M_\star = 1.23 \pm 0.07$~M$_\odot$ and $1.06 \pm 0.06$~M$_\odot$, respectively.

We also estimate the stellar ages from the empirical rotation-activity-age relations of \citet{Mamajek:2008}, as follows. We estimate the projected stellar rotation period from the spectroscopic $v\sin i$ together with $R_\star$, giving $P_{\rm rot}/\sin i = 21.9 \pm 0.6$~d and $20.7 \pm 2.4$~d, respectively, which imply gyrochronological ages of $4.2 \pm 0.2$~Gyr and $2.1 \pm 0.5$~Gyr, respectively. At the same time, the spectroscopically determined chromospheric activity indices, $R'_{\rm HK}$, imply ages of $8.4 \pm 3.6$~Gyr and $6.6 \pm 3.2$~Gyr, respectively, and predict rotation periods of $23.1 \pm 5.4$~d and $42 \pm 11$~d, respectively. Finally, placing the stars in a Kiel diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:kiel}) against the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolutionary models implies ages of $4.2 \pm 0.3$~Gyr and $4.5 \pm 1.5$~Gyr, respectively.
